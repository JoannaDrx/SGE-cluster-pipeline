#Compiling code on the cluster
Several nodes in the cluster allow you to log on from chef or sous using ssh:

iqint (64-bit Xeon)
optint2 (Opteron)
xeonint (32-bit Xeon, x86)
These nodes have a few extra packages installed (see Opteron_node_config and x86_node_config) to allow you to compile C++ and F77/F90 code. They can also be used for quick (less than 10 minutes) testing of your code. You can't log in to any other node directly.

The following compilers are available:

gcc 4.4.7 (distro standard)
clang 3.4
gcc 4.8.2
>>>  scl enable devtoolset-2 bash to enable this version of gcc

To compile optimized 64-bit code that is compatible with all Intel and AMD 64-bit processors (i.e. only MMX, SSE, and SSE2 instructions), use the following GCC flags:


-m64 -mmmx -msse -msse2


Once in chef (or sous):

ssh dreuxj@iqint



Instead download it yourself:



Copy the file "foobar.txt" from the local host to a remote host

$ scp foobar.txt your_username@remotehost.edu:/some/remote/directory


Copy the directory "foo" from the local host to a remote host's directory "bar"

$ scp -r foo your_username@remotehost.edu:/some/remote/directory/bar


If local to remote, you must not be in your ssh instance!!

looks like this:
scp Downloads/bowtie2-2.2.6-source.zip dreuxj@chef.compbio.ucsf.edu:/netapp/home/dreuxj

unzip bowtie ....

login to iqint

cd bowtie

make


mpve tp the tools folder
