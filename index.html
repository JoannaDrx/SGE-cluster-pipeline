All four schools came together on the Parnassus campus in 1898.<\/p><h4>Successful South Carolina Surgeon<\/h4><p>Born in Guilder&#39;s Creek, South Carolina, as the son of a planter and banker, Toland, himself was an entrepreneur who established a thriving medical practice. He may have been lured by the Gold Rush, but more probably came to California to find a change in climate for his wife, Mary, who was very ill with tuberculolsis.<\/p><p>Toland gained a better than average education by the standards of his day, studying medicine at age 16 and working with a doctor in the local apothecary shop. Toland entered medical school in Transylvania University in Lexington, Kentucky, where he graduated first in his class of 160 in 1828.<\/p><p>After working and saving money for postgraduate study, Toland entered the prestigious Salpetriere School in Paris, where his classmates included fellow American physician Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr. A year later, he returned to South Carolina and ran a highly successful surgical practice. Despite earning good income at the time &ndash; $15,000 a year &ndash; he was drawn to California.<\/p><p>Toland was 46 when he ventured across the country in 1852 to Mokelumne Hill in Calveras County to set up a quartz mill in the California foothills. His wife died days after their arrival and following a few weeks of failed attempts at striking it rich, Toland headed for the bustling city of San Francisco to set up a medical practice.<\/p><p>He located his San Francisco medical practice at Montgomery and Merchant streets, rising to become an acclaimed surgeon and reporting his work in the local medical journal. Toland was appointed surgeon at the predecessor to the City and County Hospital, now known as San Francisco General Hospital and Trauma Center.<\/p><p>Toland also ran one of the first mail-order businesses using Wells Fargo messengers to send medications and advice to patient customers through the connections he made while in Calaveras County.<\/p>","settings":[],"component_id":969}]}}],"backgroundImage":"","subTitle":"1864"},{"type":"sliderItem","title":"Slider Item","content":"","settings":{"isPermanent":true,"noEdit":true,"slideIndex":5},"component_id":65,"children":[{"type":"image","title":"New Image","content":"","settings":[],"component_id":1500,"src":"assets\/ucsfa-150\/1864_yosemite.jpg","caption":""}],"backgroundImage":"","subTitle":"1864"},{"type":"sliderItem","title":"Slider Item","content":"","settings":{"isPermanent":true,"noEdit":true,"slideIndex":20},"component_id":1696,"children":[{"type":"image","title":"New Image","content":"","settings":[],"component_id":1962,"src":"assets\/ucsfa-150\/1865_civil_war_3.jpg"}],"subTitle":"1865"},{"type":"sliderItem","title":"Slider Item","content":"","settings":{"isPermanent":true,"noEdit":true,"slideIndex":40},"component_id":1130,"children":[{"type":"image","title":"New Image","content":"","settings":[],"component_id":1952,"src":"assets\/ucsfa-150\/1869_early_pharmacists_3.jpg"}],"subTitle":"1869","backgroundImage":""},{"type":"sliderItem","title":"Slider Item","content":"","settings":{"isPermanent":true,"noEdit":true,"slideIndex":11},"component_id":84,"children":[{"type":"layoutBlock","title":"New Layout Block","content":"","settings":{"layout":"onetwo","midRegions":["a","b"]},"component_id":1045,"children":{"a":[{"type":"image","title":"New Image","content":"","settings":[],"component_id":1046,"src":"assets\/ucsfa-150\/1871_cole_0.jpg","caption":"<p>Richard Beverly Cole<\/p>"}],"b":[{"type":"text","title":"Cole Becomes First Dean of Medical College","content":"<h4>&nbsp;<\/h4><h4>R. Beverly Cole (1829-1901)<\/h4><p>Richard Beverly Cole, MD, the first dean of Toland Medical College, became one of San Francisco&rsquo;s most influential physicians having played major roles in the development of the Affiliated Colleges at Parnassus Heights, the creation of Golden Gate Park and the building of the City and County hospital.<\/p><p>An accomplished surgeon with an interest in public health that brought him into politics, Cole served as a member of the Board of Supervisors, state Chairman of the Democratic Party and Surgeon General of the State of California. He also was elected President of the Medical Society of the State of California and President of the American Medical Foundation.<\/p><p>Although an outspoken man whose swearing and tobacco spitting offended both men and women, Cole was known for his well-tailored clothes, personal charm and theatrical-style of teaching.<\/p><p>Born in Virginia, Cole moved to Philadelphia where he attended the Delaware Collegiate Institute and at age 16 began studying medicine. His medical education continued for a year at Transylvania University in Louisville and then Jefferson Medical College in Pennsylvania where he graduated in 1849.<\/p><p>He practiced for three years in Philadelphia, leading a hospital where he saw more than 3,000 cases of cholera. Advised to move to California for health reasons, Cole at age 23 became one of San Francisco&rsquo;s first physicians specializing in obstetrics. He had previously performed the novel procedure C- sections back East.<\/p><p><strong>Cole Takes on Toland at Murder Trial<\/strong><\/p><p>That Cole became the first dean of Toland Medical College is somewhat surprising since he opposed Toland in a court case in the murder of a patient named James King. In the 1856 &ldquo;Sponge Case,&rdquo; reported by UCSF&rsquo;s Joseph LaDou, MD, Toland was called to treat King, a friend of Cole&rsquo;s who was shot in the chest by an assassin.<\/p><p>Toland and other physicians gathered around King decided to insert a sponge to plug the wound, an idea proposed by R.K. Nuttall, MD, and opposed by Cole. King died five days later. Cole reported the case to the Medical Society of the State of California for what he considered &ldquo;gross malpractice&rdquo; in the treatment of King.<\/p><p>&ldquo;At the trial of a man implicated in King&rsquo;s murder, Toland and Cole played leading roles in the drama,&rdquo; LaDou wrote. &ldquo;If Cole was right, King&rsquo;s doctors caused his death and the man accused of his assassination should be set free. Toland&rsquo;s opinion prevailed, supported by autopsy findings that the death was caused by post-traumatic inflammation in the chest and veins.&rdquo;<\/p><p>Following the trial, Cole went to Europe, where he studied medicine and surgery in France, Germany and England. Among the many honors he received during this time, he was named a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons.<\/p><p>Cole eventually reconciled with Toland and served as dean of Toland Medical College and the medical department of the University of California from 1873 to 1882.<\/p><p>Cole remained a faithful supporter soliciting donations for the University of California Medical School &ldquo;with the skill and grace of a medieval friar.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>","settings":[],"component_id":1047}]}}],"backgroundImage":"","subTitle":"1871"},{"type":"sliderItem","title":"Slider Item","content":"","settings":{"isPermanent":true,"noEdit":true,"slideIndex":12},"component_id":87,"children":[{"type":"image","title":"New Image","content":"","settings":[],"component_id":1953,"src":"assets\/ucsfa-150\/1872_sfgh_11.jpg"}],"backgroundImage":"","subTitle":"1872"},{"type":"sliderItem","title":"Slider Item","content":"","settings":{"isPermanent":true,"noEdit":true,"slideIndex":14},"component_id":93,"children":[{"type":"image","title":"New Image","content":"","settings":[],"component_id":1954,"src":"assets\/ucsfa-150\/1873_toland_parnassus_13.jpg"}],"backgroundImage":"","subTitle":"1873"},{"type":"sliderItem","title":"Slider Item","content":"","settings":{"isPermanent":true,"noEdit":true,"slideIndex":13},"component_id":90,"children":[{"type":"image","title":"New Image","content":"","settings":[],"component_id":1819,"src":"assets\/ucsfa-150\/1873_cable_car_1.jpg"}],"backgroundImage":"","subTitle":"1873"},{"type":"sliderItem","title":"Slider Item","content":"","settings":{"isPermanent":true,"noEdit":true,"slideIndex":20},"component_id":112,"children":[{"type":"image","title":"New Image","content":"","settings":[],"component_id":1955,"src":"assets\/ucsfa-150\/1875_pharmacy_lab_0.jpg"}],"backgroundImage":"","subTitle":"1875"},{"type":"sliderItem","title":"Slider Item","content":"","settings":{"isPermanent":true,"noEdit":true,"slideIndex":21},"component_id":1699,"children":[{"type":"image","title":"New Image","content":"","settings":[],"component_id":1956,"src":"assets\/ucsfa-150\/1875_mark_twain_1.jpg"}],"subTitle":"1875"},{"type":"sliderItem","title":"Slider Item","content":"","settings":{"isPermanent":true,"noEdit":true,"slideIndex":23},"component_id":123,"children":[{"type":"layoutBlock","title":"New Layout Block","content":"","settings":{"layout":"onetwo","midRegions":["a","b"]},"component_id":957,"children":{"b":[{"type":"text","title":"First Woman Graduates From Medical School","content":"<h4>&nbsp;<\/h4><h4>Lucy Field Wanzer (1840-1930)<\/h4><p>Wisconsin native Lucy Wanzer became the first woman to graduate from a California medical school in 1876.&nbsp;<\/p><p>As a child, Lucy Field knew she wanted to become a doctor when caring for her mother who had tuberculosis.

Grodsky and John Karam (1929-2002)<\/h4><p>A team including Gerold Grodsky, MD, emeritus professor of Biochemistry, Biophysics and Medicine, and John Karam, MD, made discoveries linking obesity to Type 2 diabetes in 1963, producing findings that resulted in revolutionary changes in diabetes treatment and prevention.<\/p><p>Grodsky developed of the first precipitating radio immunoassay (insulin). His research has focused on the mechanisms involved in the synthesis, storage and secretion of insulin, with an emphasis on the kinetics and quantitative relationships of these mechanisms. He is now active in the development of the algorithms required for a practical artificial pancreas, the organ that regulates blood sugar with the production of insulin and glucagon.<\/p><p>He and Karam were the first to report that elevated blood sugar caused abnormal structures in cells in 1980, helping to pioneer the intensive glucose control strategies now used throughout the world for managing diabetes.<\/p><p>Grodsky has published more than 225 articles, predominately dealing with regulation of insulin synthesis\/secretion, and has been an invited lecturer in more than two-dozen countries. He is the recipient of many research awards, including a merit award from the National Institutes of Public Health, and the Rumbaugh Award of the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, which also gives an Annual Gerold Grodsky Award for basic research in diabetes.<\/p><p>While growing up in Shreveport, La., Karam had first-hand experience with the disease he would dedicate his life to understanding. His mother was diabetic, a fact which he credited as motivating his interest in medicine.<\/p><p>Part of the UCSF Metabolic Research Unit and Endocrine Division faculty from 1961 until 2002, Karam&rsquo;s accomplishments include discovering that hyperinsulinemia is associated not only with Type 2 diabetes but with obesity alone.<\/p><p>Karam also demonstrated the insulin-sparing effects of the biguanides, the type of drug widely used today to treat Type 2 diabetes. With Jack Gerich, Karam defined the role of glucagon, the hormone that raises glucose blood levels (the opposite effect of insulin, which decreases those levels), in normal physiology and diabetic pathophysiology. With Graeme Bell, he was the first to describe a diabetes type I susceptibility gene (IDDM 2).<\/p><p>From 1980 until his retirement in 1993, Karam was the Chief of Clinical Endocrinology at UCSF. He and Grodsky were the first to report that elevated blood sugar caused abnormal structures in cells in 1980, helping to pioneer the intensive glucose control strategies now used throughout the world for managing diabetes.<\/p><p>He received the American Diabetes Association Outstanding Educator Award in 1993. In addition to about 150 scientific publications, John contributed multiple chapters relating to diabetes, hypoglycemia and obesity to the Lange Medical Series that were published in several languages.<\/p><p>His commitment to improving access for quality medical care in the US and abroad made him an important international clinical figure. He was an active member of Doctors without Borders and Flying Doctors, a northern California volunteer group that provides medical and dental care to Mexican villages. He provided free medical care to the uninsured and to illegal immigrants in San Francisco&rsquo;s Mission District.<\/p>","settings":[],"component_id":1152}],"a":[{"type":"image","title":"New Image","content":"","settings":[],"component_id":1153,"src":"assets\/ucsfa-150\/1963_grodsky_1.jpg"}]}}],"backgroundImage":"","subTitle":"1963"},{"type":"sliderItem","title":"Slider Item","content":"","settings":{"isPermanent":true,"noEdit":true,"slideIndex":14},"component_id":1742,"children":[{"type":"image","title":"New Image","content":"","settings":[],"component_id":1743,"src":"assets\/ucsfa-150\/1963_jfk.jpg"}],"subTitle":"Nov 1963"},{"type":"sliderItem","title":"Slider Item","content":"","settings":{"isPermanent":true,"noEdit":true,"slideIndex":15},"component_id":1745,"children":[{"type":"image","title":"New Image","content":"","settings":[],"component_id":1746,"src":"assets\/ucsfa-150\/1964_free_speech.jpg"}],"subTitle":"1964"},{"type":"sliderItem","title":"Slider Item","content":"","settings":{"isPermanent":true,"noEdit":true,"slideIndex":17},"component_id":1750,"children":[{"type":"image","title":"New Image","content":"","settings":[],"component_id":1751,"src":"assets\/ucsfa-150\/1964_kidney.jpg"}],"subTitle":"1964"},{"type":"sliderItem","title":"Slider Item","content":"","settings":{"isPermanent":true,"noEdit":true,"slideIndex":8},"component_id":401,"children":[{"type":"layoutBlock","title":"New Layout Block","content":"","settings":{"layout":"two","midRegions":["a","b"]},"component_id":1154,"children":{"b":[{"type":"text","title":"John Saunders Becomes First Chancellor","content":"<p>John B. de C.M Saunders, MD, the son of a British army surgeon of Scottish ancestry and a&nbsp;veteran of the medical school faculty, served as UCSF&rsquo;s first chancellor.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Saunders enjoyed a&nbsp;60-year&nbsp;career at UCSF, where he&nbsp;served in a number of positions, including being a professor and chair of the Department of Anatomy, librarian, dean of the&nbsp;medical school and the first provost.&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/history.library.ucsf.edu\/saunders.html\">Read more.<\/a><\/p><p>Saunders was reportedly the strongest voice to oppose Herbert Evans in the struggle to keep the medical school in San Francisco.

For more than 25 years, he has studied how life-threatening fetal abnormalities alter normal physical processes. He developed techniques for both open surgery and minimally invasive surgery to repair many birth defects. Harrison&#39;s team also developed in utero stem cell transplantation to treat immune system deficiencies, enzyme deficiencies and abnormal hemoglobin in the blood.<\/p><p>Harrison joined UCSF in 1978 because it offered the best opportunity to explore the possibility of fixing certain fetal anatomic defects before birth to avoid the devastating and sometimes irreversible consequences he encountered in newborns.<\/p><p>During the 1980s and 1990s, he and his research colleagues developed and refined many of the techniques that have made fetal surgery the fast-evolving and major contribution it is within the surgical profession and within fetal therapy itself. Harrison worked closely with obstetricians, anesthesiologists, geneticists, sonographers, surgical sub-specialists, neonatologists, nurses, and ethicists to lay the foundation for what would be the multidisciplinary UCSF Fetal Treatment Center, the first fetal treatment center in the United States now entering its third decade.<\/p><p>In 1984, he published the first comprehensive textbook on fetal therapy,&nbsp;The Unborn Patient: Prenatal Diagnosis and Treatment, which is now in its third edition.

Szostak of Harvard Medical School.<\/p><p>The scientists discovered an enzyme that plays a key role in normal cell function, as well as in cell aging and most cancers. The enzyme is called telomerase and it produces tiny units of DNA that seal off the ends of chromosomes, which contain the body&rsquo;s genes. These DNA units &ndash; named telomeres &ndash; protect the integrity of the genes and maintain chromosomal stability and accurate cell division.

Her work in mentoring, diversity, and women&rsquo;s leadership has been recognized campuswide, citywide, and nationwide.&rdquo;<\/p><p>Navarro has come a long way since her days growing up in Mobile, Alabama, during the time of Jim Crow laws. She remembers walking with her mother who urged them to cross the street because White people were approaching.<\/p><p>Navarro recalls questioning her mother, struggling to understand why and sensing the injustice, indignity and unfairness of the racial segregation laws of the 1960s.<\/p><p>Today as UCSF&rsquo;s first African American woman to serve as vice chancellor, Navarro leads the University&rsquo;s efforts to practice its core principles of inclusiveness, equity and humanity.&nbsp;<\/p><p>&ldquo;Diversity is about inclusion and equity and it&rsquo;s about recognizing the strengths that we all bring to campus,&rdquo; Navarro said. &ldquo;Women still struggle to reach levels of parity within our organization.

Navarro says her mother also steered the direction of her career path.&nbsp;<\/p><p>&ldquo;My mother started saying, &lsquo;You are so smart. You should be a doctor.&rsquo; But she had no understanding of what it would take for me to attend medical school.&rsquo;&rdquo;<\/p><p>The idea seemed far-fetched at first, Navarro explains, since she had not seen a black doctor until she was well into her teen-age years. But having come from a family of strong-willed women, Navarro&rsquo;s interest was peaked.&nbsp;<\/p><p>To get a feel for a career in life sciences, Navarro shadowed a pharmacist at a local drug store. The experience prompted her decision to pursue pharmacy and she earned her PharmD degree at the University of the Pacific in a five-year accelerated program. While working as a clinical pharmacist, she was exposed to patient care and enjoyed the interaction with other health professionals.<\/p><p>&ldquo;While working as a clinical pharmacist, I was exposed to medical residents and it was just a matter of gaining confidence that I could practice medicine, too. I knew I could make a difference in patient care,&rdquo; she said.<\/p><p>Navarro served a one-year internship in internal medicine at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, and returned to UCSF for a three-year residency in anesthesiology. Because of the support of her physician mentor, Cedric Bainton, MD, Navarro joined the UCSF faculty in 1990.&nbsp;<\/p><p>As a medical student, her first job was working as a pharmacist at the UCSF-affiliated San Francisco General Hospital and Trauma Center (SFGH).

Clements, MD, a pediatric pulmonologist at UCSF, has saved untold lives of fragile newborns with&nbsp;his seminal contributions to the understanding of how lungs hold air.<\/p><p>He and his colleagues&nbsp;developed&nbsp;a lifesaving treatment for respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in premature infants. Once this country&#39;s largest contributor to infant mortality, resulting in 30,000 deaths each year in the United States, RDS has been reduced by 97 percent.<\/p><p>His insights have increased the understanding of the essential role of pulmonary surfactant in normal lung function, a discovery that led to replacement surfactant as a treatment for RDS and the genesis of a new area of pulmonary biology.<\/p><p>Replacement surfactant is now a standard therapy for premature infants in most countries, and it is also being examined for its applicability to other diseases, such as adult RDS, asthma, cystic fibrosis and pneumonia.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Since joining the UCSF faculty in 1960, Clements has worked closely with its neonatologists, including Sam Hawgood, MBBS, now chancellor at UCSF, to incorporate physiological concepts and methods into the care of severely ill newborns.<\/p><p>Clements and colleagues also developed one of the world&#39;s first intensive care nurseries and trained many fellows who have become leaders in academic medical centers around the world. Throughout his career, he has focused on research and teaching.<\/p><p>Now as professor emeritus, Clements continues his work part-time as an academic scientist at UCSF. With his long-time colleague Jon Goerke, MD, UCSF professor emeritus and Cardiovascular Research Institute fellow, and electron microscopist Jacob Bastacky, MD, he currently is investigating an ultra-rapid freezing method to view layers of surfactant as fine as one micron thick.<\/p><p>The researchers seek to detect a subtle gradient in surface tension that may play a role in expelling contaminants from the alveoli and small airways in the lungs, and may offer clues to disorders such as asthma and obstructive pulmonary disease.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Clements continues to write and edit scientific articles and to consult with colleagues and fellows on research problems. Keenly attuned to current developments in surfactant biology, he anticipates application of new knowledge to a variety of lung diseases.<\/p><p><strong>From Cornell University to Cardiovascular Research Institute<\/strong><\/p><p>Clements was born in Auburn, New York, on March 16, 1923. He decided at the age of eight or nine to become a scientist, but was unsure whether to choose chemical engineering or medicine. After his father sent him on a tour of industrial chemical engineering laboratories, Clements made up his mind to pursue medicine.<\/p><p>As a medical student at Cornell University, he was frustrated by how little could be known about the medical condition of each patient, and concluded that he would not be satisfied in medical practice. Therefore, he skipped his internship after graduating and joined the department of physiology at Cornell Medical College in 1947.<\/p><p>Two years later, Clements answered an appeal to physicians to volunteer service in the U.S. Army. While serving at the United States Army Medical Research Laboratory at Edgewood Arsenal, MD, he was directed to look into causes and possible treatments for lung damage from nerve gas. Clements learned all he could about the lungs and became interested in how surface properties of the lungs allowed them to have such a large internal surface area.<\/p><p>Clements developed an interest in pulmonary function and began to elucidate the physical and chemical properties of a previously unknown natural material he named &ldquo;lung surfactant.&rdquo; He concluded that a surfactant would decrease surface tension and prevent lung collapse during exhalation.<\/p><p>Clements stayed on at Edgewood as a scientist in the civil service. During this time, he also held positions at the University of Pennsylvania, Roswell Park Memorial Institute in Buffalo, and at Johns Hopkins University.<\/p><p>After joining the faculty at UCSF, Clements started a laboratory at the Cardiovascular Research Institute in 1959. He and his colleagues identified the major fatty, or lipid component of natural surfactant, dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine. This is the portion of surfactant that has particular properties for stabilizing the alveoli, the tiny air-exchanging chambers of the lungs, by reducing surface tension.<\/p><p>He continues to work at UCSF several days a week, writing, editing, consulting and working with colleagues to complete research on surface tension in the lung&rsquo;s airways &mdash; research that may have numerous clinical applications. In addition, he has been active throughout his career in editorial duties for scientific journals and in service to professional societies.<\/p><p>Clements has received many additional honors for his research discoveries, including the 1994 Albert Lasker Clinical Medicine Research Award, the National Medical Research Award of the National Health Council (1992) and the Gairdner Foundation International Award (1983).&nbsp;<\/p><p>He is a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians, London (1986), a member of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences (1974) and a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (2002).&nbsp;<\/p>","src":"assets\/ucsfa-150\/Clements.jpg","alt":"John Clements, Professor Emeritus"},{"description":"<h4>Father&#39;s Direction Put Genetics Pioneer on Path to Scientific Achievement<\/h4><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>Yuet Wai Kan, MD, DSc, an internationally recognized leader in the field of human genetics, was the first to establish that a single DNA mutation could result in a human disease.<\/p><p>He demonstrated this in sickle cell anemia and thalassemia, and was the first to diagnose a human disease using DNA.&nbsp;He discovered DNA polymorphism, which is now extensively used for genetic analysis.<\/p><p>Kan is the Louis K.
